# password-manager
Password manager program that is written in Python. All users and passwords are stored in an encrypted mysql database. 

The program's architecture is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) model. You will find a folder containing unit test as well, as I followed standard coding principles.

The program uses a couple libraries including:

*PyQT
*mysql-connector
*sys

The program was designed with the end-user in mind, however, the database is run locally just for the purpose of making sure everything worked.

 This program was a summer project just for fun.
